What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing refers to amalgamation of use of computer technology known as computing and Internet-based development known as cloud. In simple terms, cloud computing is a massive network of computers or servers located in one location (typically referred to as a Cloud data center) that are accessed remotely by a user. It is massively scalable and globally available on-demand, with much lower capital expenses than traditional hosting centers for eBusiness applications and services (which have been around for decades). This allows you to deploy your application when needed and since it was designed from the ground up to be highly automated, it will pay for itself with reduced operating expenses and redundant systems so there is no single point of failure. Delivering all types of services on the Internet is called cloud computing. Cloud computing services come in many forms including storage, server, database, software, networking, intelligence, and analytics.

Cloud computing is a popular way of running a business. The reason behind adopting its services is their numerous advantages including that it can defer expenses, let you work in a self-service manner remotely, be fully scalable depending on the need, provide optimum performance at all times, and make sure your data is safe and secure.

Cloud computing features three levels of connectivity: cloud, network devices like routers and switches, and end-user. The cloud comprises resources like virtual desktops, software platforms, servers, applications, and data storage. They process data through routers and switches. The end-user can access the information from any device.

Cloud Computing Architecture

The cloud computing architecture consists of two fundamental components, the front end, and the back end. The front-end is the client of such architecture and communicates with the backend through a network or internet connection. In cloud computing architecture, the client-side or front-end becomes visible to other entities whereas the backend remains hidden from contact with anyone on the outside, yet it is able to communicate directly with its client through a predetermined protocol.

The backend of cloud architecture helps protect vital information from the demand of client-facing technology. It receives queries about your data and responds appropriately. The backend is an important aspect of your overall computer system that makes up a big part of the entire cloud concept.

In a business setting, it’s important to find the compatible software and hardware that go into making up the cloud environment. It’s best to start with off-the-shelf components. Highly scalable servers will be useful in handling the increasing need for data storage & processing power. Paired with this, you’ll need a comprehensive suite of reliable applications customized for your business’s specific needs & budget!

Moves to the cloud are aplenty, but picking the perfect one can be hard. The best kind of cloud architecture for your business deals with all the software and hardware components. Ineffective cloud computing planning can result in more overhead, less scalability, and therefore a lower return on investment. Operating on the best type of computing architecture is important because it saves your time and money along with making sure that you’re equipped for the future so you don’t have to worry about your data falling behind when you need something higher-powered.

Components Of Cloud Computing Architecture

The important components of the cloud computing architecture are as follows:

Front-end platform
Back-end platform
Cloud-based delivery


The front-end and back-end of any platform are the face and brains, respectively. Cloud-based delivery allows one to transmit information via application platforms that exist on the cloud. Three popular types of infrastructure that can be used with cloud-based delivery services include Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), Platforms-as-a-service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS).

What is Front-End Cloud Architecture?

The front-end infrastructure of a cloud computing business platform is basically everything the end-user interacts with. It is the broader assimilation of various sub-components that together offer the user interface. This determines how the end-user connects to cloud computing as a whole. In addition to local networks, web browsers, and web applications, it also includes things like graphics cards and operating systems that provide access to customized programming from providers like Google and Microsoft.

Let us understand major front-end components.

1. User Interface: The user interface is essentially the familiar, everyday interface that you experience each day. Cloud creates a seamless environment where end-users can complete tasks without ever needing to open up any software on their local machines. For example- you interact with your smartphone, desktop computer, or tablet—all of which rely on an interface in order to work properly. Some popular interaction interfaces are Google Docs, Gmail, and Evernote.
2. Software: The software architecture in the front end is what runs on the user’s end. Frontend software architecture principally consists of client-side applications or browsers which are in charge of presenting data to users.
3. Client Device or Network: The hardware at the end user’s side is referred to as the client-side device. As a crucial part of the frontend architecture, it can be any input device like your mouse, keyboard, or sound card. In cloud computing, the client-side device doesn’t require extraordinary ability to process the heavy load. Your cloud will take care of that job and process the same.
